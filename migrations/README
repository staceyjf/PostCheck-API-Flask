## About

Having built these API in Springboot, I wanted to explore implementing JWT auth in other frameworks so I thought I'd kill two birds with one stone and rebuilt my Postcheck API in Flask to brush up on my Python skills and also continue to practice implementing JWT auth.

This is a work in progress so watch this space.
